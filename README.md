1. Hello, this is my first-ever data-analysis project.  
2. I will try to derive interesting conclusions from Netflix Original's dataset.  
3. Since my dataset is from Kaggle, I will use opendatasets library to download it.  
4. Then I import numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn for analysis purposes.
