1. Hello, this is my first-ever data-analysis project.  
2. I will try to derive interesting conclusions from Netflix Original's dataset.  
3. Since our dataset is from Kaggle, we use opendatasets library to download it.  
4. Then we import numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn for our analysis purpose.
